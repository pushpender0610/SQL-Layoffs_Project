This project delves into the world of layoffs using a dataset from Kaggle. The primary goal is to clean the data, ensuring its accuracy and consistency for further analysis. We'll focus on addressing duplicates, standardizing data formats, handling null values, and removing irrelevant columns/rows. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques will be employed to uncover interesting patterns and trends within the layoff data.

Key Steps:

Data Acquisition:
The dataset is retrieved from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theakhilb/layoffs-data-2022).


Data Cleaning:

Duplicate Removal: We'll identify and eliminate duplicate entries in the dataset, ensuring the data's integrity.
Data Standardization: Data formats, including dates and potentially industry categories, will be standardized for consistency. Inconsistencies like variations in capitalization or punctuation will be addressed.
Null Value Handling: We'll carefully analyze null values and determine appropriate handling strategies, such as retaining or imputing values based on industry standards or data patterns.
Column/Row Removal: If necessary, columns or rows containing irrelevant or unusable data will be removed after careful consideration.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Metrics like maximum and minimum values, sums, and averages will be calculated for various attributes to gain insights into the layoff trends.
Visualizations: Data will be visualized through charts and graphs to reveal patterns and trends that might be less apparent in raw tables. We'll explore factors like:
Company Layoffs: Companies with the most layoffs overall, both on single days and cumulatively over time.
Location: Areas with the highest total layoffs.
Country and Year: Trends in layoffs across countries and over different years within the dataset timeframe.
Industry: Industries most affected by layoffs.
Stage: Layoff patterns among companies at different funding stages (e.g., Series A, Post-IPO).
Additional Queries: We'll delve deeper with more complex queries, such as:
Identifying companies with consistently high layoffs year-over-year.
Calculating rolling totals of layoffs per month to observe trends.


Outcomes and Deliverables:

A clean, well-structured dataset ready for further analysis.
Insights gleaned from the EDA, documented in the form of visualizations, charts, and textual summaries.
